# Summary

Iteration 4 of B cell plus myeloid panel. This report contains descriptions of human samples used, panel information, staining protocol, instrument and acquisition settings, and the generated .fcs files. The data analysis section outlines the workflow for assessing single color control quality and optmiziation of unmixing. To evaluate spectral unmixing, Iterations of unmixing matrices were applied to single stained cell controls and healthy and disease samples,images and links to relevant plots. Lastly, an OMIP section was created to house data we need for the OMIP.

## **Controls**

-   Controls were run on VersaComp beads and healthy PBMCs
-   All single-color controls were stained in standard 96-well round bottom plates
-   Heat killed PBMC were used as a control for Viakrome808 viability dye
-   Unstained controls were collected for beads, healthy, and CLL

## **Prepared Reagents**

-   PBMC thaw media (RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS)
-   Staining buffer (PBS + 0.5% BSA)
-   Premixes of:
    -   Viakrome808 in PBS (1:400)
    -   FMMs, mini-panels, and full panel diluted in staining buffer + BV Buffer (1:20)
    -   Human Fc (1:20) + monocyte block (1:20) in staining buffer

## **Staining Procedure**

**Thawing PBMCs**

PBMC vials were placed in a 37C water bath until a samll ice crystal remained and PBMCs were transferred to 10 mL of thaw medium, spun at 400 x g for 10 minutes, and washed 1X before counting.

**Blocking and Staining**

PBMCs were pre-blocked in Human Fc and monocyte block (1:20) for 15 minutes and aliquoted to 5mL FACS tubes or 96-well plates for staining. Cells were resuspended 100 uL Viakrome808 and stained for 15 minutes at RT in the dark and washed 2X. Samples for panel staining were resuspended in 50uL of IgG mix for 15 minutes before adding 100 uL of 1.5X Ab cocktail. For bead controls, 1 drop of Versacomp beads + 1.5 uL of Ab-fluor conjugate was added to wells of a 96-well plate. For cell controls, 45uL of staining buffer + appropriate volume of Ab-fluor conjugate added to wells followed by 50uL of cell suspension adjusted to to 5e6 cells/mL. Samples and controls were stained for 30 minutes at RT and washed 3X before acquisition.

## **Instrument QC and Settings**

**Instrument QC**

Instrument was QCd on the day of acquistion (7/22/25) but did not pass for all detectors. The instrument passed QC the day it was serviced by Nelson on on 7/11/25.

**Instrument and Acquisition Settings**

-   Control and sample data were recorded in three experiment files
-   Assay gain settings were applied to all tubes/wells
-   all samples run at medium medium flow rate

### **single color control files** {.tabset}
If a bead control filename contains _new, it means I reran this control at a later time. If a filename contains _cleaned, it is a cleaned control file and contains a subset of events from the original control file. 

[Link to raw single-color control files](https://app.box.com/folder/333247847268)

## **Overview of the workflow**

-   raw bead and cell control .fcs files were loaded into two separate experiment files (CytExpert off-instrument).
-   scatter and spectral ribbon plots were examined for each control one by one.

## **Unmixing Matrix #001** {.tabset}

### **Description**

First unmxing matrix attempted. All controls were cleaned for contaminating events. All spectral controls are beads except for Viakrome808 (viability) and R720-IgA (I don't think this clone binds to VersaComp beads very well).

A complete copy of the unmixing experiment (.xitsp file + .fcs file directory with control files can be found [here](https://app.box.com/folder/334368687874))

### Description and files

All-bead matrix (except viakrome808-viability and R720-IgA) ghost events appearing in the spectral ribbon were cleaned from the control files and imported back into unmixing experiment
